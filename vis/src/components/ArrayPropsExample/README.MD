**Array Props Examples**

Figuring out how to do class based Vue.js components.  It was a little dissapointing to find out that there are multiple ways of doing it but no consensus.

All of the contained examples work and show no linter problems (with some tsLint option tweaking)

In the rest of the poc I am using method 2 with the vue-class-component and the vue-property-decorator because it seems to be the cleanest.
